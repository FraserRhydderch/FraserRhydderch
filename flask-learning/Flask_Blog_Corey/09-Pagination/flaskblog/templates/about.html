<p>The UK defence sector makes a significant contribution to our security, prosperity and global influence. It leads the way in technological and industrial innovation, providing our Armed Forces with the capabilities it requires to keep our nation safe from external threats and aggression, and supporting the UK’s collaboration with our friends and allies across the world. The UK defence sector is a key element of the advanced manufacturing sector and supports wider economic stability and growth, providing livelihoods to local communities in every nation and region of the UK, often with highly skilled and rewarding roles.</p>

<p><strong>The Defence Prosperity Programme – Establishment of the Joint Economic Data Hub</strong><br />Quantifying the defence contribution to the UK economy is an important component of the Defence Prosperity Programme which was announced to Parliament in March 2019. The Joint Economic Data Hub (JEDHub) is central to improving our understanding of the defence sector’s contribution to the economy, putting it on a similar footing to other sectors. By drawing on both the expertise and data held by Government and industry, the JEDHub aims to provide better, more consistent and impartial data, which will improve our understanding of the economic contribution of the defence sector (at a UK, national and regional level) and inform decision making. As part of initial efforts to improve data, a successful proof of concept pilot took place in 2020 with DGP companies which focused on gathering high level defence employment data. The pilot proved it was possible to gather data direct from defence companies through a survey and to create an aggregated data set and undertake analysis. Since the proof of concept pilot, the JEDHub reached an Initial Operating Capability (IOC), which highlighted our current understanding of the defence sector’s economic contribution and explained our approach to support the delivery of a Full Operating Capability (FOC). These activities, which include maturing our approach to industry data capture and the establishment of an annual survey of defence sector companies, are being taken forward collaboratively through the JEDHub Delivery Working Group (DWG).¹             </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>JEDHub Annual Survey 2021 - Purpose and Products</strong><br />The purpose of this survey is to grow Government and industry’s understanding of the economic contribution of the defence sector. By collecting a standard set of data from companies through this survey, an aggregated data set representing a significant share of the Defence Sector will be produced. This year’s survey, building on last year’s proof of concept activity, grows both the coverage of data covered and enhances the granularity of data to build a stronger understanding of an important element of the UK Defence Sector. In parallel we are also working closely with the Office of National Statistics to access relevant microdata to support a richer analysis. This allows the JEDHub to draw analysis from those companies responding to the survey, around national and local employment of the sector, an approximation of where jobs sit within different military capability sectors and by domestic and international customers, the demographic make-up of the UK defence workforce and an estimate number of indirect jobs supported by defence spending/purchases with the supply-chain.    Individual company responses will only be used to create the aggregated data set, and not for any other purpose. Analysis will be undertaken on the aggregated sector data set of the companies responding. No data will be imputed or modelled to provide missing data entries.  The data requested in this survey will not be used to support specific defence procurement or tender evaluation choices.  </p>

<p>The JEDHub will produce a report that sets out high-level employment analysis from the aggregated data set of companies responding, which will be shared within the MOD, members of the JEDHub Delivery Working Group, members of the DGP and companies who responded to the annual survey. The JEDHub will use the survey results alongside other sources of data collected by Government and external sources and compare results against economy and manufacturing benchmarks. We expect to make aspects of the aggregated results of the annual survey publicly available. We plan to consult with Defence Industry around the JEDHub’s approach to the presentation of information made publicly available. Ultimately, by having an agreed set of definitions on how to measure the defence sector, related turnover and employment, industry and MOD will be better positioned to articulate the benefits of investment in the sector.  </p>

<p><strong>Future Surveys</strong><br />With future annual iterations, this survey should become the principal source of data on the defence sector’s contribution to the UK economy, with the resulting aggregated data set of companies responding used alongside other data sources to improve the understanding of the economic value of Defence and provide trend data, similar to other parts of the economy. As we seek to improve our understanding of the economic contribution of the defence sector to the UK economy, we may need to expand areas of future surveys, which will require continued and close engagement with industry, as well as ensuring we have an agreed set of definitions and methodologies.  Whilst initially being excel based, the intention is to move it to a web-based platform, which will:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make it easier for industry to respond</li>
    <li>Automate a large amount of manual data handling</li>
    <li>Provide industry with a view of their own company data that they have provided.</li>
    <li>Facilitate easier and faster scale up. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Andy Sams (andrew.sams749@mod.gov.uk); Lisa Hole (Head of Industrial Policy) – Lisa.Hole272@mod.gov.uk, or Glenn Kelly (Executive Director - International Markets, Prosperity and Innovation at the UK Defence Solutions Centre) – Glenn.Kelly@ukdsc.org                       </li>
